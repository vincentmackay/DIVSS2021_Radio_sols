    "The theory behind Fourier transforms requires that the transform be performed on an infinitely long time signal. However, we don't have infinite time on our hands, and we also want to know how to power spectrum changes over time, so we perform the Fourier transform on a short portions of our time series. The duration of those portions is $t = N\\Delta t$, where $N$ is the number of time samples in each of our Fourier transforms, and $\\Delta t$ is the time between the samples. The trade-off of a shorter $t$ is a less precise frequency resolution $\\Delta \\nu_{res}$. Indeed, the power $P(\\nu)$ as written above really describes the power within $\\nu$ and $\\nu + \\Delta \\nu_{res}$, where \n",

    "According to the **Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem** (commonly referred as the Nyquist theorem), the sampling interval $\\Delta t$ determines the maximum width of the sampled band $\\Delta \\nu$. The main idea that underpins this theorem is that a high frequency sinusoidal wave can be confused with a sinusoidal wave of a lower frequency if the time between the samples is too short. The figure below illustrates this phenomenon, where two signals of different frequencies will be indistinguishable if the sampling intervals are too short. In this case, we say that the higher frequency is *aliased* down to the lower frequency. Hence, the Nyquist theorem tells us that to avoid aliasing, the width of the sampled band must not exceed $\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta t^{-1}$."

Indeed, our signal is aliased (copied) in the 1.3 to 1.4 GHz band, then in the 1.2 to 1.3 GHz band, etc., all the way to the 0 to 0.1 GHz band, where it could theoretically be sampled at a 0.2 GHz sampling rate.
